PygmenTeX is a Python-based LaTeX package that can be used for
typesetting code listings in a LaTeX document using Pygments.

Pygments is a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds of
software such as forum systems, wikis or other applications that need to
prettify source code.

In order to use PygmenTeX you need to have Pygments installed. If you
need instructions on installing it, please refer to its home page at
http://pygments.org/.

The file pygmentex.py should be installed as an executable file in a
directory in the PATH.

The file pygmentex.sty should be installed in a directory where TeX
searches for input files.

The file demo.pdf demonstrates the use of the package.
